Mentee assignment from IBM Advance AI @ Infinite Learning Course completion of Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Document Using LLM from CognitiveClass.ai

## Overview

Welcome to the "Creating a Simple Chatbot with Open-Source LLMs using Python and Hugging Face" repository! This project is a mentee assignment from the IBM Advance AI program, built upon the completion of the "Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Document Using LLM" course from CognitiveClass.ai. In this project, we explore the creation of a straightforward chatbot using open-source Language Models (LLMs) with Python and the Hugging Face Transformers library.

### Key Highlights

- **LLMs Integration**: Learn how to leverage open-source Language Models, such as GPT-3, BERT, or others, using the Hugging Face Transformers library.

- **Python Implementation**: Develop the chatbot using Python, taking advantage of the language's simplicity and versatility.

- **Interactive Conversation**: Implement functionality to enable an interactive conversation with the chatbot, providing a seamless user experience.
